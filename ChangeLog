25.10.2007: (LB)
	* compatibility bugfixes with pyx-version 0.9 in:
	  pyxgraph.py + examples/plot_3d_1.py + examples/plot_3d_2.py
	* ChangeLog dates corrected

25.10.2007b: (AB)
    * version 0.2.5.

25.10.2007: (AB)
    * corrected problem in matplotlib_pyx.py that matplotlib 
      cannot write jpegs anymore in recent versions.
      Unfortunately this means that PIL has to be used explicitly in that 
      example.

25.10.2007: (AB, sl):
    * renamed 3dplot1.py, 3dplot2.py to plot_3d_1.py and plot_3d_2.py
    * test for PyX>=0.10 added in these two examples 
    * Remarks on installation added to README
	  
18.10.2007: (sl)
    * examples/3dplot1+2.py: examples for 3d plots added

18.10.2007: (sl)
    * pyxgraph.py: added object pyxgraph3d with new method pyxplotsurface:
                   It is a first attempt to bring the new 3d options of pyx
                   (>= 0.1) to pyxgraph. Only basics are implemented yet,
                   All methods in pyxgraph3d have to be tested! Labels look 
                   strange, overlaying surfaces?, ...

24.09.2007: (mr)
    * added support for specification of levels and colors as arrays 
      of the same length to pyxplotcontour

19.09.2007: (sl)
    * pyx_objects.py: added pyxerrorbar, for plotting data with errorbars
                      added pyxdimlabel, for plotting labels with arrows, see:
    * examples/make_labels_with_arrows.py
    * examples/errorbars.py

30.08.2007: (MM)
    * little change in 'contour.py' due to numpy transition of nonzero
    * removed 'raw_input' in 'examples/matplotlib_pyx.py'

02.08.2007: (sl)
    * pyx_objects.py: some changes on pyxplothist (for plotting histograms)

13.07.2007: (sl)
    * pyx_objects.py: graphcoords for pyxarrows are now interpreted
                      logarithmically if the axis is a logarithmic one

25.04.2007: (WW)
    * pyx_objects.py: def pyxplothist (for plotting histograms)
    * examples/histogram.py: histogram example added 
    * axes.py: related to change of 23.08.2006: (some NotImplementedError cancelled) 

23.03.2007: (AB)
    * sans_serif_fonts2.py example added

16.02.2007: (JL)
    * color_provider.py: accept any iterable instead of only list and tuple
        (passing a 3 element array would result in black)

15.02.2007: (JL)
    * styles.py: bugfix in linepattern_from_strings ('_' not interpreted
      as intended)

14.11.2006: (LB)
    * pyxgraph.py:  pyxcolorbar -> textattrs added; now you can change size
	  of labels
	
06.11.2006: (AB)
    * contour.py: use numerix instead of numpy (otherwise PyXgraph does
      not work on Numeric only installations). Evil hack in numerix.py added
      because `any` does not exist in Numeric. 
      As a consequence contouring is not useable under Numeric.

20.09.2006b: (JL)
    * examples/array5.py: bitmap plot was upside down (did not matter bc. of
                          symmetry)

20.09.2006: (JL)
    * pyx_objects.py: pyxplotcontour: fixed placement of line labels
                      and corrected docstring

19.09.2006: (JL)
    * contour.py: added documentation

18.09.2006: (JL)
    * color_provider.py: Fixed bug with numpy float types.
    * numerix.py: NewAxis = newaxis (numpy compat.)
    * pyxgraph.py: Fixed bug in pyxgraph.pyxplot._check_attr
                   added pyxgraph.pyxplotcontour
    * contour.py: added (routines for calculating contour lines from 2d array)
    * pyx_objects.py: def pyxplotcontour
    * examples/array4.py, examples/array5.py: contour plot examples
    
07.09.2006: (SL)
    * examples/axes16.py: shows how to make ticks without numbering

29.08.2006: (JL)
    * pyxgraph.py: pyxgraph.pyxplot: Docstring (linetype & title kw's)

28.08.2006b: (JL)
    * styles.py: added linepattern_from_string
                 (string like '-.-.' -> linepattern)
    * pyxgraph.py: in pyxgraph.pyxplot: accept lt=<string>
    * examples/styles_example3.py: added

28.08.2006: (JL)
    * examples/simple4_arrows_labels.py: added multiline label (with parbox)

23.08.2006: (WW+SL)
    * styles.py: new linestyles for two-coloured dashed lines added
    * axes.py: new axistype for axes with fractional numbers added 

21.07.2006: (LB)
    * examples/axes3.py: legend with smaller text inserted
	* pyxgraph.py: - renamed graphics to self in pyxplot :)
				   - color counter added in pyxplot 
				     -> increment only if color=None

13.07.2006: (AB)
    * examples/simple3_inset.py: hack example for smaller fonts for insets

28.06.2006b: (AB)
    * ColMapperNumeric.py: Array2PIL modified as well.
	
28.06.2006: (AB)
    * ColMapper.py: Array2PIL can now handle lookup tables with up
      to 65536 entries. This should lead to smoother color
      appearances, in particular for segmented color maps.

03.07.2006: (NH)
    * examples/array3.py: Fix for Numeric and numpy

30.06.2006: (SL)
    * examples/array3.py: example for using the segmented color mapper added

28.06.2006: (AB)
    * pyx_objects.py: pyxsave uses paperformat per default now
      (corrects a bug in the ordering for checking for None/False/..)

09.06.2006: (SL)
    * ColMapperNumeric.py: segmented color mapper added

08.06.2006: (SL+ WW)
    * ColMapper.py: first version of segmented color mapper with example
                    added, some new color functions

24.05.2006: (AB)
    * version 0.2.4.
	
15.05.2006: (AB)
    * support for gv bugfix (no user visible change, apart
      from the factor 1.6 in file size for bitmaps)

09.05.2006: (AB)
    * pyxsave: accept `use_paper_format=pyx.document.paperformat.A3`

23.04.2006: (AB)
    * removed some ``print type()`` which were left-over from 
      debugging the type problem.

25.04.2006: (SL)
    * examples/axes14.py: new example using linear y-axis with
                          ticks in exponential notation

23.04.2006: (AB)
    * some small modifications to numerix.py: should import 
      either Numeric or numpy, depending on whether
      any of these is already imported.
      If none of them is imported, numpy is tried first.
    * Some remark wrt. ColMapper.py, framework of thoughts
      on segmented color maps: SegmentedColorMapping
	
21.04.2006b: (AB)
    * fixed bug reported by Waltraut Wustmann:
      In color_provider.py: _to_pyxcolor_eval(val)
      the construct 
	``if type(ident) is int:``
      was used. For elements of an numpy array, e.g. arange(10)
      the type is <type 'int32scalar'> and the above condition is never true.
      Replacing this by 
        ``if isinstance(ident, int):``
      seems to cure the problem.

      WARNING: there might be further ones like this lurking around.
      Please report (and we have to check the code)
	
21.04.2006: (WW)
    * COMMON_PROBLEMS: problems with integer-type in color-arguments (counter)

21.04.2006: (AB)
    * examples/colorbars.py: reduce number of examples
    * pyx_objects.py: pyxbitmap  and pyxplotarray use dctquality=100
      as default. The file size seems to be only slightly larger,
      but now no artefacts in the bitmaps are visible.
	
13.04.2006: (AB)
    * Code cleanup for ColMapper.py. Full conversion to numpy.
      For compatibility, the old ColMapper.py for Numeric lives 
      on as ColMapperNumeric.py
    * matplotlib_pyx.py: does not work on my laptop with
      In [2]: matplotlib.__version__ Out[2]: '0.87.2', 
      cp-matplotlib  0.87.1.2150-1.
      (could be my laptop, or it there might be a newer 
       matplotlib package, which I cannot access from my laptop
      due to the super-duper firewall on our debian group-server)
	
04.04.2006: (JL)
    * pyxgraph.py: For compleneteness, replaced every check of the form
      ``xyz == types.SomeType`` by the more pythonic
      ``xyz is types.SomeType``
    * axes.py, pyx_objects.py: same.

04.04.2006: (JL)
    * pyxgraph.py: l.570 fixed the bug that occured when using
      numpy (comparing array to string) and added checking for
      Unicode string. All examples pass now with numpy.
    * numerix.py: Uncommented numpy section and moved to top.

25.03.2006: (AB)
    * axes.py: another argument to ticks so that only every m-th tick
      gets a label:
      If you want no subticks, but labeling of every 2nd tick only, then choose:
      cticks=(0.0, 4.0, 1.0, 0, 2)
      This is in particular convenient for log-scales, e.g.
      yticks=(0.0001, 1000, 100.0, 0, 5).
	
24.03.2006: (AB)
    * examples/symbols.py: suggestion by Nikolai incorporated to use
      ``pt=i`` in the example.

24.03.2006: (AB)
    * filled_regions.py: example wish by LarsS:
      fill the region defined by a sequence of points
      by converting them to a path which can be stroked and filled.

20.03.2006: (AB)
    * axes.py: fixed bug reported by Nikolai concerning ticks for log-scales.
      (let's see if it does not introduce other problems).	

17.03.2006: (AB)
    * examples/matplotlib_pyx.py: is working again

15.03.2006: (AB)
    * examples/sans_serif_fonts.py: better documentation on the need
      for downloading sfmath.sty	

15.03.2006 (SL):
   * pyxgraph.py: xpaint and ypaint can be set to False, so that 
                  x- and y-axis are not plotted, see
   * examples/axes13.py:

14.03.2006: (AB)
   * pyxgraph.py: compressmode from "Flate" to "DCT" as default.
     It turns out that Flate is Postscript level 3 
     (and not the other way round ...).  
     See e.g.: http://www.capcode.de/help/filter, 
     "postscript language reference".
     One can check a resulting file by  grep -i filter filename
	
14.03.2006: (AB)
   * examples/sans_serif_fonts.py (+sfmath.sty) added.
	
09.03.2006: (AB)
   * pyx_objects.py: pyxsave  
      By using A4 as paperformat the resulting plot is centered on A4.
      Consequenes:
         - one can print the resulting file
         - one can ensure that no negative bounding box coordinates arise
      If the plot is larger than A4 a warning will be issued
      (this is only true with PyX SVN> 09.03.2006). 
	
07.03.2006: (AB)
   * pyxgraph.py: improved colorbars
   * examples/colorbars.py: all possible variants for colorbars.
	
05.03.2006: (AB)
    * pyx_objects.py: graphcoords for pyxbitmap.
    * examples/matplotlib_pyx.py: finally got rid of the border from matplotlib.
	
27.02.2006: (AB)
    * made title working again after ``self.domethods`` was removed from PyX.

20.02.2006: (AB)
    * examples/axes11.py: axes without any ticks
    * examples/axes12.py: minor ticks example
    * axes.py: support for minor ticks.
	
19.02.2006: (AB)
    * examples/axes10.py: demonstrate different painters.
    * examples/doc_string_extract.py: extract doc-strings without importing
      (all `if __name__=="__main__":` could go *again*, 
	but this time I better wait)
    * pyxgraph.py, axes.py: extensive changes for painter stuff
      (hope it works).	 
		
18.02.2006: (AB)
    * examples/bitmap2.py: make lines hidden behind the bitmap.
    * pyxgraph.py: `pyxplotarray` routine: see array1.py and array2.py 
      examples
    * all examples: added `if __name__=="__main__":` again.
      The reason is that make_html.py does import each example
      to extract the docstring at the beginning of the file.
      We don't want to recreate the graphics in this case.
    * examples/amsmath_and_xscale.py: new example which demonstrates
      the use of different fonts. It also shows a change of the font size.	
	
   
	
16.02.2006: (AB)
    * TODO list updated with suggestsion from Joerg Lehmann and Andre Wobst
    * all examples updated to use  `g.writeEPSfile` directly.
    * pyxgraph.py: removed vdist specification from
      ``curr_key = pyx.graph.key.key(pos=key, vdist=0.1*pyx.unit.cm)``
      (why should we use bad defaults, if PyX does the job already perfect?;-)
	    
13.02.2006: (AB)
    * axes.py: support for "pi" axes
    * examples/axes7.py: adapted example accordingly.
	
12.02.2006: (AB)
    * pyxgraph.py: no ipython for debugging 
    * pyxgraph.py: pyx_xlabel, pyx_ylabel for aligning labels with ticks labels
    * pyxgraph.py: pyx.graph.data instances are allowed for data
	
07.02.2006: (AB)
    * pyx_objects.py: removed a "so what ???" ;-)

07.02.2006: (AB)
    * examples/axes8.py: key outside of the graph example from Nikolai

07.02.2006: (AB)
    * examples/matplotlib_pyx.py: keep MPL quite.

07.02.2006: (AB)
    * pyxgraph.py: repaired pyxsave & related ones.

07.02.2006: (AB)
    * forgotten pyx_objects.py added

07.02.2006: (AB)
    * Big round of changes:
    * pyxgraph_helperfuncs.py renamed to color_provider.py
    * pyxgraph.py, pyxplot:
      - `plottype` is replaced by `style`
      - `linestyle` is replaced by linetype (and `ls` by `lt`)

	Reason: `linestyle` fits better with `pointstyle`
        and is also what gnuplot uses.
        `plottype` is very long and a bit misleading, as
        it suggests to refer to the whole plot, even though
        it just specifies the style ("lines", "linespoints", "points")
        of a particular line. 
    * pyx_objects.py: the routines
      pyxsave, pyxbitmap, pyxlabel, pyxarrow, pyxline 
      from pyxgraph.py are moved there.	
    * pyxgraph.py:  _scaled_symbol: moved to styles.py
    * new axis.py: with _setup_manualticks, _setup_axis
	
30.01.2006: (AB)
    * COMMON_PROBLEMS
    * TODO (points from Nikolai)
    * pyxgraph.py: make pylint happier
    * howto_pylint.txt explains how to use pylint
    * pylint_rcfile  (slightly tweaked ;-)
	
30.01.2006: (AB)
    * pyxgraph.py: corrected bug in pyxarrow	
	
28.01.2006: (AB)
    * pyxgraph.py: for `plot_dat`: when a filename is given
      an additional dictionary of keywords can be passed on to
      pyx.graph.data.file().
      E.g.: skiptail=100 to skip the last 100 entries in the file:
	g.pyxplot(("datafile.dat", 1, 2, dict(skiptail=100)), plottype="l")
    * examples/axes2.py: example for `skiphead` and `skiptail` added.
    * pyxgraph.py: new keyword `lineattrs` for additional 
      line attributes.
    * examples/styles_example2.py: demonstrate `lineattrs` 
      via miter, bevel and round.
    * examples/styles_example.py: stylistic corrections.
	
27.01.2006: (SL)
    * styles.py: filled triangle up size corrected.

20.01.2006: (SL) 
    * styles.py: new color set 'rainbow' added
    * examples/colors.py: shows new colors

20.01.2006: (AB) 
    * examples/matplotlib_pyx.py: example of using a matplotlib generated 
      graphics embedded in PyX (useful for Poincare sections ;-)
	
19.01.2006: (AB)
    * pyxgraph.py - pyxbitmap: problem with compressed bitmaps and 
      `compressmode="Flate"` solved by setting `compressmode=None`
      for .jpg files (compression of a compressed image not supported).	
	
19.01.2006: (JL)
    * pyxgraph.py:
        pyxbitmap: turned compression off again (not working on my PC)
        pyxgraph.pyxplot: added linecolor= keyword
    * examples/simple1.py:
        now one graph with color=... and linecolor=...

18.01.2006: (AB)
	* pyxgraph.py: dashlength/dl support for individual lines
	* examples/styles_example.py: example styles_example.py 
	  which demonstrates different linestyles (which was in colors.py), 
	  and variation of the dashlengths.

17.01.2006: (JL)
    * In pyxgraph.py:
        * l.213ff: For the refactorization of class pyxgraph to work, these 
            functions had to be defined before the class. 
        * l.511: refactorization (simpler than the wrappers)
        * l.666: changed to .get (handles error case better)
        * l.668: added simple error check (imho enough)
        * l.806: use _to_pyxcolor now
    * In pyxgraph_helperfuncs.py: (File created)
        * function _to_pyxcolor written
    * examples/colors1.py created and added to make_html.py
    
17.01.2006 (AB):
	* pyxgraph.py: pyxplot:
	   Setting `title` to False for plot: no title, for sure:
           - False: not title (i.e. key) - for sure
           - None: auto-numbering (if key is enabled)
           - "string"

17.01.2006: (AB)
	* pyxgraph.py: compressmode von None auf "Deflate" als default.

14.01.2006: (AB)
	* styles.py: `linepattern_factory` and `provide_styles` 
	  added so that we can pre-define different dashlengths easily.
	* adapted examples to show a couple of the features
	* WARNING: Backwards incompatible change: dashed lines
	  look differently now. 

12.01.2006: (AB)
	* pyxgraph.py: fix so that also logarithmic axes can have no ticks.

12.01.2006: (AB)
	* examples/make_html.py: removed the need for `laps` to 
	  generate `examples.ps`

11.01.2006: (AB)
	* pyxgraph.py: backwards incompatible change:
   	    default_painter = pyx.graph.axis.painter.regular(
	            basepathattrs=[pyx.style.linewidth.Thick],
                    tickattrs=[pyx.style.linewidth.thick])    
	  changed to 
  	    default_painter = pyx.graph.axis.painter.regular()

	  (Reason: the defaults look alright to me ...)

11.01.2006: (AB)
	* example with pi axis 
	* improved examples.ps (includes the source code)
        * doc-string for all examples move to the top of the file

10.01.2006: (AB)
        * examples with labels 
	  (note: title not yet implemented)
	* pyxgraph: comment improvement for keys

10.01.2006: (AB)
	* several ticks enhancements, see the new axes4.py axes5.py and axes6.py
	  examples

09.01.2006: (AB)
	* pyxgraph: `col` keyword removed - color should be enough
        * pyxgraph: class pyxgraph renamed to PyxGraph 
	* loads of code adaption to new coding style
	* pyxgraph: Setting xticks=False or yticks=False 
	  means that no tick labels
	  will be plotted for the corresponding axis.
	* pyxgraph: color can also be a pyx.color.color instance
	  (just to make things even more flexible ;-)

05.01.2006: (AB)
	* makehtml.py: latex output added
	* pyxcolorbar improvements
	* _setup_axis can now eat an axis instance

05.01.2006: (SL)
	* styles.py: triangle up symbol corrected 

04.01.2006: (AB)
        * styles.py: moved star symbol further to the end
	  (as + and x  gave *, this was indistinguishable in plots ...)
	* examples: code clean-up

03.01.2006: (AB)
	* xrange, yrange --> xlimits and ylimits (sorry!)

22.12.2005: (SL)
	* symbols.py and styles.py examples demonstrate new linestyle
	  capabilities
	
15.12.2005: (AB)
	* clean up of examples, addition of script make_html.py
	  to generate overview of all examples.

13.12.2005: (AB)
	* for plotting of datafiles: allowed strings as
	  arguments for specifying the columns to enable
	   "$1/$5" a la gnuplot.

13.12.2005: (AB)
	* key positioning via string (eg. "tl", "tr",....) added 

06.12.2005: (AB)
	* ColMapper.py added (needs code clean-up!!)
	* examples/array_example.py
	
05.12.2005: (AB)
	* renamed legend to key to pyxgraph
